# #] PRIZ PLAYER ;]
A music player with a terminal aesthetic

# #] REASON
As a Kubuntu user, I've been using KDE's Elisa for quite a while. Elisa is a slow music player that
for some reason plays the same track several times in a row in shuffle mode and cannot enter single track
mode. I decided to make my own music player with a terminal aesthetic because that looks neat.

# #] NOTICE
This is still in the alpha phase, so you're going to have to install VLC and Python 3.7+ yourself.

For linux users, do not use the provided desktop file, because that is for my use only for now.

have to do
